This code was created for data collection and analysis for the second lab on HI and waveguides. The main functions for use are found in the files collectdata.py, spectra.py and waveguides.py. Work done with these functions to generate my final conclusions was done partially through terminal, and partially through the Ipython Notebooks here.
